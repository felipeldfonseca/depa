## 1. Executive Summary

Depa revolutionizes digital product creation by combining AI Departments with marketplace infrastructure to break the time barrier that kills most digital entrepreneurs. Instead of spending 3-6 months creating a single product that often fails, users can launch multiple digital products in 1-3 days, rapidly test markets, and find winning products through volume and velocity.

**Mission:** Eliminate the "idea paralysis" that prevents digital product creation by providing the world's fastest product-to-market pipeline.

**Revolutionary Strategy:** Create a digital product factory that launches real products at unprecedented speed, proving the platform's capabilities through actual marketplace results rather than demos or promises.
