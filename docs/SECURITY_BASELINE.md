# Security Baseline - AI Departments Platform

## Overview

This document establishes the security baseline for the AI Departments Platform, covering authentication, authorization, threat modeling, and security controls for a multi-tenant SaaS platform handling sensitive business data and AI agent communications.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Tenant RBAC System

**Tenant Isolation**
- Strict tenant isolation using `org_id` in all database operations
- Row-level security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL
- Namespace isolation for Redis keys: `{org_id}:{resource_type}:{id}`
- API-level tenant validation on every request

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```
Tenant Roles:
├── Owner (full access, billing, user management)
├── Admin (manage departments, agents, integrations)
├── Manager (configure agents, view analytics)
├── User (interact with agents, view outputs)
└── Guest (read-only access to specific departments)

System Roles:
├── Platform Admin (cross-tenant support)
├── Security Admin (audit, security config)
└── Support Agent (limited tenant access for support)
```

**Permissions Matrix**
- Department management: Owner, Admin
- Agent configuration: Owner, Admin, Manager
- Integration setup: Owner, Admin
- Billing management: Owner only
- User invitation: Owner, Admin
- Data export: Owner, Admin (with audit log)

### Authentication Implementation

**Primary Authentication**
- JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens (30 days, rotated on use)
- Secure httpOnly cookies for web sessions
- API keys for integrations (scoped, rotatable)

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- TOTP-based (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- SMS backup for critical operations
- Recovery codes (10 single-use codes)
- Mandatory for Owner and Admin roles
- Optional but encouraged for other roles

**Session Management**
- Concurrent session limits (5 per user)
- Session invalidation on role changes
- Device tracking and anomaly detection
- Automatic logout after 24h of inactivity

## Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

### API Rate Limiting
```
Tier-based Rate Limits:
├── Authentication: 10 req/min per IP
├── Public API: 100 req/min per API key
├── Agent Operations: 50 req/min per org
├── File Uploads: 10 req/min per user
└── Bulk Operations: 5 req/min per org
```

**Implementation**
- Redis-based sliding window counters
- Per-IP, per-user, per-org limits
- Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- Rate limit headers in responses
- Bypass for internal services

### DDoS Protection
- Cloud Load Balancer with DDoS protection
- Geographic IP filtering (configurable)
- Request size limits (10MB max)
- Connection limits per IP
- Automatic IP blocking for suspicious patterns

## Secret Management & Encryption

### Secret Protection
- Google Secret Manager for production secrets
- Kubernetes secrets for container environments
- No secrets in code, configuration files, or logs
- Automatic secret rotation (90 days)
- Secret access auditing

### Encryption Standards
**Data at Rest**
- AES-256 encryption for database
- Encrypted file storage (Cloud Storage)
- Key encryption keys (KEK) in Cloud KMS
- Database-level encryption for PII fields

**Data in Transit**
- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- mTLS for internal service communication
- Certificate pinning for mobile apps
- HSTS headers with preload

**Application-Level Encryption**
- PII encryption with user-specific keys
- Agent configuration encryption
- Chat history encryption
- Search index encryption for sensitive data

## Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

### Spoofing Threats
**Risks:**
- Impersonation of users/tenants
- API key theft and misuse
- Session hijacking

**Mitigations:**
- Strong authentication with MFA
- JWT signature verification
- API key rotation and scoping
- Session binding to device fingerprints

### Tampering Threats
**Risks:**
- Malicious prompt injection
- Agent configuration tampering
- Data manipulation attacks

**Mitigations:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Agent prompt templates with safety constraints
- Configuration change auditing
- Database integrity constraints

### Repudiation Threats
**Risks:**
- Denial of actions performed
- Lack of audit trails
- Non-attributable changes

**Mitigations:**
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Digital signatures for critical operations
- Immutable audit logs
- User action attribution

### Information Disclosure
**Risks:**
- Tenant data leakage
- AI model prompt/response exposure
- Internal system information disclosure

**Mitigations:**
- Strict tenant isolation
- Output sanitization and filtering
- Error message sanitization
- Network segmentation

### Denial of Service
**Risks:**
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- AI model abuse
- Database overload

**Mitigations:**
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Resource usage monitoring
- Circuit breakers
- Auto-scaling with limits

### Elevation of Privilege
**Risks:**
- RBAC bypass
- Tenant boundary violations
- Admin privilege escalation

**Mitigations:**
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular permission audits
- Multi-level authorization checks
- Separation of duties for critical operations
