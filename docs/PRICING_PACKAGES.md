## Executive Summary

Our pricing strategy targets global digital product creators who want to escape the "analysis paralysis" cycle and launch multiple products rapidly. The model focuses on subscription revenue rather than marketplace commission, allowing creators to keep 100% of their product sales while paying us for the creation factory access.

**Core Strategy:** "Digital Product Factory Subscription" - unlimited product creation model where creators pay monthly for access to AI departments that can create and launch multiple products. Optimized for global English-speaking markets with high digital product demand.

## Pricing Philosophy

### 1. Value-Based Pricing Principles

#### Customer Value Delivered
- **Time Compression**: 3-6 months product development → 1-3 days
- **Risk Reduction**: Test 10+ ideas for cost of 1 traditional product
- **Revenue Acceleration**: Multiple revenue streams vs single product dependence
- **Barrier Elimination**: No technical skills needed for product creation

#### Pricing Psychology
- **Volume Value**: Unlimited product creation vs per-product pricing
- **Marketplace Independence**: No commission on sales - creators keep 100%
- **Transparent**: Clear monthly subscription with no hidden fees
- **Global**: USD pricing for international market accessibility

### 2. Competitive Positioning

#### Versus Hiring Agencies/Freelancers
- **50-100x cheaper** than agency-created products ($5K-15K per product)
- **100x faster** delivery (days vs months)
- **Unlimited revisions** vs limited scope

#### Versus DIY with ChatGPT
- **Structured workflows** vs scattered conversations
- **Complete execution** vs just content generation
- **Marketplace integration** vs manual publishing
- **Quality assurance** vs unfiltered AI output

#### Versus Course Platforms (Teachable, Thinkific)
- **Product creation included** vs just hosting
- **Multi-format support** vs course-only focus
