# Marketplace Specification
## AI Departments Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-13  
**Owner:** Felipe PM + Claude  
**Status:** PLANNING (POST-MVP)  

---

## Executive Summary

The AI Departments Marketplace transforms our platform from a closed system into an extensible ecosystem where third-party developers can create and monetize AI departments, templates, and integrations. This creates additional revenue streams, accelerates innovation, and provides customers with specialized solutions for niche industries and use cases.

**Meta-Strategy Alignment**: The marketplace becomes a demonstration of how our AI departments can manage and scale a two-sided marketplace - using our own Growth department to acquire vendors and our Customer Service to support marketplace transactions.
