# Depa
**The Fastest Digital Product Factory in the World**

---

## 🚀 Vision

Depa breaks the time barrier for digital product creation by combining AI Departments with marketplace infrastructure. Instead of spending months creating and testing products that often fail, entrepreneurs can launch multiple digital products in days, fail fast, and find their winning product faster than ever.

## 🎯 Mission

Transform anyone into a digital product entrepreneur by providing AI-powered creation factories that generate, launch, and manage multiple products simultaneously. No more being stuck with one failed attempt - create dozens of products until you find your winner.

## 💡 Revolutionary Strategy

**The Digital Product Factory Approach:**
- AI Departments create complete digital products (ebooks, courses, templates, communities)
- Instant integration with Whop marketplace for checkout, delivery, and scaling
- Launch 10+ products in 30 days, validate quickly, double down on winners
- Eliminate the "ChatGPT paralysis" - go from idea to live product in 1-3 days

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Core Platform:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11 + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **AI Services**: Multi-provider orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage)

**Marketplace Integration:**
- **Primary**: Whop API for product creation, checkout, and delivery
- **Future**: Gumroad, Etsy Digital, Shopify marketplace expansion
- **Payment Processing**: Handled by marketplace partners
- **Content Delivery**: Automated through marketplace infrastructure
